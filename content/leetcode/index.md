![[leetcode/attachments/linked list painting.webp|300]]

leetcode for me was just something i needed to be ok at for the on-campus interviews in college. funny enough, i ended up not sitting for most of them. i had bigger dreams, and even bigger fish to fry in smaller ponds. 

this doesn't mean i didn't enjoy cracking the problems, or optimizing them. i however have always taken a lot more pride in building actual tangible products. so putting my time towards solving conceptual problems although fun always felt like a waste of time if i wasn't also building something at the same time.
