my one true [[peek/the fall of naruto|love]] and my favorite technology that i like to build applications with. i've been meaning to checkout ios for a while but i need a mac for it. developing for android has gotten soo much better with [jetpack compose](https://developer.android.com/compose) that's a breeze and a joy to cook up new apps from scratch. 

despite all the advances in developer tools with kotlin, the extension libraires, the [art runtime](https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime#AOT_compilation), there are still several caveats and gotchas in android development. making sense of all the concurrency tools provided by kotlin like coroutines and flows, and using them efficiently while being aware of their limitations and rough edges is why it pays to be a developer. 

i note down things about android development that i find interesting or that i experiment with on my that will appear here . feel free to reach out if you have any thoughts. links in the footer.
