Imagine an application—a digital archive that adapts to your curiosity. It’s a place where any topic can come to life at your fingertips. You ask questions, and it generates notes, quizzes, and pathways tailored just for you. Dive deep into a topic, branch off into new ones, or loop back to the central idea—everything stays connected, waiting to be explored further. 

But this isn’t just a passive experience. With built-in spaced repetition, the app keeps your knowledge fresh, nudging you at the right moments to revisit and solidify what you’ve learned. Whether you're preparing for interviews, acing exams, planning speeches, or simply satisfying curiosity, it offers a system to collect, refine, and retain insights.

As AI continues to grow more capable, our ability to use it effectively will define how we thrive in a complex world. Tools like this—a way to interact with, archive, and selectively research thoughts—can help us make the most of the flood of information we encounter every day. A future where learning isn’t about keeping up, but staying in sync with what really matters to you.

This is a small seed of an idea I’m working on—an evolving thought on how we might reimagine learning, one question and one branch at a time.
