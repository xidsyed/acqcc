A refuge for the week and cowardly, a semblance of order and progress in their meaningless and chaotic lives. 



I've come to be very bitter and cynical of productivity and minimalism concepts like [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)   and their gurus with their iPads and aesthetic notion templates over the years. 


Once a naive little boy, I used to believe that the effort and time spent on creating brain-organizer or a productivity-tracker actually had the intended effect. Waste of time. 


You can just do things.
