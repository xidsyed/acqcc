The first time I understood what an abstract syntax tree was, I was sitting in a dimly lit dorm at 2 AM, surrounded by empty coffee cups and half-eaten snacks. I'd been staring at compiler diagrams for hours counting down the hours to my mid-terms.

It hit me when I was doodling in my notebook, breaking down a simple "hello world" into a tree diagram out of sheer boredom. That's when it clicked – computers read code the same way I used to break down sentences in elementary school grammar classes. Subject, predicate, object. Function, parameters, return value. It wasn't the realization really, but how obvious it was. How it had always been there, a core structural concept of reality.  

Here we were, building these elaborate structures just to help computers understand us, like creating a meticulous translation guide for a very literal-minded friend. Every piece of code I'd ever written was just a very organized tree, waiting to be traversed.

Now whenever I write code, I sometimes imagine it as this living, breathing tree. Each function call is a branch reaching out, each variable declaration a new leaf unfurling. The compiler is just a very methodical gardener, pruning and shaping these digital trees into something that can actually run. I guess this is what people the [[thoughts/digital gardens|digital gardeners]] out there try to hold on to. A way to simplify life into its core principles.

It's a bit silly, perhaps, but it makes me wonder about all the abstract trees we build in our lives – the hierarchies of ideas, the branching paths of decisions, the nested structures of our daily routines. Sometimes understanding something deeply doesn't make it less magical; it just gives you a new kind of wonder to carry around.
