# the author

after 4 years of acquiring my computer science degree, having [[leetcode/Reverse LinkedList in Groups of K|reversed several linked lists]], learning about support vector machines and what an [[thoughts/abstract syntax trees|abstract syntax tree]] is, there wasn't much left to do but [[thoughts/on reshaping how we learn|transform the world]] with all that *computer science knowledge* one commit at a time. so here i am now with a beat-up acer and a dream on my back

## ðŸš§ currently cooking 
as the lone chef in my digital kitchen i made the ever so popular mistake of cooking too many things at once. most of them would inevitably end up on the proverbial *back burner*. here on out we have only two burners:

- **albatross** research and review
	- a spaced-repetition and active-recall based personal knowledge application to explore, archive and interface with information.
- **ciicii** spaces
	- virtual Space for being productive with friends. A gamified virtual space where you level up by finishing your goals


## ðŸŽ‰ served 
these are my older projects that have already been completed. they have been cooked to ~~perfection~~ satisfaction and served on my github for your perusal

#### kurunai - a benchmarking dsl 

a lightweight kotlin library that provides a simple idiomatic dsl in kotlin for benchmarking and profiling your code 
- defines, composes, and executes benchmarks easily using **kotlin dsl**  
- a benchmark is essentially a `time` block which is a named block of code that needs to be timed for the benchmark.  this block can be further composed of nested `time` blocks.
- having a nested composable structure allows for detailed benchmarking and profiling of code.
- supports modular benchmarks and generates detailed performance reports

there are several more projects sitting [[thoughts/on reshaping how we learn|on the shelf]] or on my [github](https://github.com/xidsyed). for now im trying to stay focused on the important ones. anything of note will be published above. 

# the blog


![[garden.webp|300]]


this blog is my journal and mental archive, where I publish my [writing](/posts) on the things I explore and work on. a lot of my writing focuses on [android](/tags/Android)  at the moment, but youâ€™ll also find random [experiments](/tags/experiment) or friday night [philosophications ](/tags/philosophy). I also publish [shorter posts](/thoughts) just for the joy of it. have a look around. enjoy. 

you can find my socials along with my resume in the footer. don't hesitate to reach out. enjoy!
