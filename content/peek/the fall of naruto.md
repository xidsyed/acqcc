after what they did to naruto with boruto back in 2019. It’s like they took the original magic sauce and swapped it for some 'generic story with forgettable main character that tries to be relatable and funny but the story no real struggle or consequnces...   sauce'. the stakes went from _world-saving heroics_ to "let’s fix a wi-fi outage in konoha." if naruto ran a thousand miles for greatness, boruto just needs a solid nap and a participation trophy. it's not "**Believe It**," but "Believe me, I’m trying... to stay awake."
